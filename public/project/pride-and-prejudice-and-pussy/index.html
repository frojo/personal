<h1>Pride and Prejudice and Pussy</h1>
<p>As part of the <a href="http://commiserate.life/sthack">Object Oriented Orgasm Hackathon</a>, <a href="http://www.katygero.com/">Katy Gero</a> and I procedurally generated erotica.</p>
<p>Using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-3">GPT-3</a> and a corpus of erotica scraped from <a href="http://textfiles.com/sex/EROTICA/">textfiles.com</a>, we produced such hot and surreal excerpts as:</p>
<p><em>“And then they spanked me with the butt that they'd given to me in the shower,&quot; he said.</em></p>
<p><em>Elizabeth wanted her tongue to fuck her. She wanted to make her cum but decided that she had to be in a position where she could not reach it. She grabbed her pants and started to lick them.</em></p>
<p><em>I can't, and I can't swallow my cock, so I'll just drink it, and eat it all. But I'll come, and I'll come if it's not too hard for me, and I want it to come in my mouth.</em></p>
<p><em>And then they sucked me in like a wet dog. I could feel the inside of my pussy. I was sure it was a mixture of pleasure and hum.</em></p>
