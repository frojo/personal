<h1>Portfolio Website for Ali Lim</h1>
<p>Ali is an illustrator and game designer.</p>
<p>In mid-2023, they were looking for a redesign of their portfolio website that reflected their growth as an artist as well as their development into a game designer.</p>
<p>I delivered a turnkey project, both redesigning and coding the site. I designed a visual identity that matched the style and tone of their art and their games, as well as showcased their art i:w
n a more playful space.</p>
<p>The final design features a skeumorphic &quot;pile&quot; of draggable frames as well as web elements inspired by the old web and the handmade web.</p>
