  Engineer, educator, and designer living in Brooklyn, NY.

For example, a <a href="https://dumpling.love/">a websitepark that grows organically from the whims of its creators</a>, or <a href="/work/souls.html">a subversion of "social network"</a>, or a <a href="https://frojo.itch.io/camping">visual novel</a>. 

  They use a variety of tools and software, including p5js, Unity, React, Godot, Threejs, PICO-8, Bitsy, Javascript/HTML/CSS, and Twine.
